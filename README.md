# -BPM-Prediction-Mastery-Data-Harmonization-Advanced-Ensemble-Techniques
BPM Maestro is a comprehensive machine learning solution for predicting song tempo (Beats Per Minute) from audio features. This project demonstrates advanced techniques in feature engineering, model ensembling, and prediction optimization that achieved top-tier performance in the Kaggle Playground Series S5E9 competition.



üìò Overview

This project was developed as part of the Kaggle competition ‚ÄúProblematic Internet Use‚Äù hosted by the Child Mind Institute.
The goal is to predict problematic internet usage among adolescents based on a variety of psychological, behavioral, and demographic features.

The notebook focuses on data harmonization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the construction of an ensemble model to improve predictive performance through blending.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Harmonization

Combined multiple datasets with different structures.

Standardized column names and formats.

Handled missing values and corrected inconsistencies in the data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized the distribution of main variables.

Studied correlations between demographic and behavioral features.

Identified potential patterns linked to problematic internet use.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

Created new meaningful features to enhance the model‚Äôs learning capacity.

Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical features.

Removed irrelevant or redundant variables.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building & Ensemble Learning
